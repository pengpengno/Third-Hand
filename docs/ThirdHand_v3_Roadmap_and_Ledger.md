# ThirdHand v3 Redesign Ledger and Roadmap

> **Canonical status (2026-08-20):** This is the active implementation ledger.
> `ThirdHand_Architecture_v3_consolidated.md` is the paired authority contract.
> `ThirdHand_v3_Strategy_AI_Lab_Design.md`,
> `ThirdHand_v3_Fullstack_Technical_Roadmap.md`, and
> `ThirdHand_v3_Personal_Universe_Review_Watchlist_UX_Design.md` are approved
> subordinate design specifications; they do not override this ledger or the
> paired architecture.
>
> **Completed:** Phases 1-4 core repository implementation, DecisionContinuity,
> most Phase 5 ledger enforcement, and the governed weekly/daily/60m/15m/5m
> Evidence + asymmetric Multi-Timeframe ActionPolicy path.
>
> **Active correctness/runtime acceptance:**
> - Phase 5 paper-execution deployed acceptance (#46);
> - financial currentness / event-driven financial refresh deployed Xiaomi/HK
>   acceptance (#39);
> - Tier-1 CorporateEvent lifecycle deployed acceptance (#49);
> - configured-provider Decision AI live recovery acceptance (#40).

## Current implementation decision

The formal action path remains intentionally conservative:

```text
DecisionContext
  -> EvidenceEngine
  -> ActionPolicy
  -> Atomic Evidence / ResearchAssessment
  -> DecisionArbiter
  -> Multi-Timeframe ActionPolicy
  -> DecisionContinuity
  -> formal_action
  -> ExecutionPrecheck
```

Atomic Evidence and AI explanations are persisted and audited beside this path.
`ResearchAssessment` is an explicit, asymmetric arbiter input: high-confidence
ADVERSE research can veto only new BUY/ADD risk. It cannot upgrade an action or
create REDUCE/EXIT. Governed 60m/15m/5m state may preserve, delay or downgrade
new risk but cannot manufacture BUY/ADD or create REDUCE/EXIT by itself. AI
never receives authority over price/time, quality, market rules, sellable
quantity, hard gates, sizing or formal action.

Daily-use orchestration is now designed as a separate concern:

```text
PersonalUniversePolicy
  -> ReviewPolicy
  -> AnalysisDepthPolicy
  -> Formal Decision when review is authorized
```

This separates who deserves attention, when review is due, how deep research may
run and whether trading is permitted.

## A. Consolidated ledger disposition

Legend:
- KEEP = required v3 design item.
- MERGE = valid concern, implemented inside another v3 component rather than a standalone subsystem.
- DEFER = useful but not current P0/P1 or insufficiently specified.
- CLOSE = benchmark/runtime observation; keep as evidence, not a permanent product component.

|---|---|---|
| TH-DATA-001 quote vs daily time mismatch | KEEP | CanonicalInputSnapshot + consistency validation |
| TH-DATA-002 stale quote mixed with fresh indicators | KEEP | executable/display authority separation |

| full-stack product observability | KEEP | Backend -> API -> Android -> observable reasons/errors required before `PRODUCT_DONE` |
| PersonalUniversePolicy | KEEP / IMPLEMENTING | Portfolio + Watchlist remain primary daily universe; PUX1 backend/API is under CI in #86 and Android remains pending |
| ReviewPolicy / AnalysisBudget | KEEP / DESIGNED | scheduler wake-up is not analysis permission; NO_REVIEW/GUARD_ONLY/POSITION_REVIEW/FULL_RESEARCH |
| Personal vs Experiment universe separation | KEEP / DESIGNED | mutable user Watchlist must never silently contaminate frozen Evaluation universe |
| first-class Android Watchlist | KEEP / DESIGNED | user must manage Watchlist and see review state without admin/log access |

## B. Current-code conformance findings

1. The former held `NO_TRADE -> REDUCE` behavior is removed from formal semantics; held WATCH resolves to HOLD.
2. Market regime, lot and settlement selection are market-scoped. The formal paper account is CNY-only. HK Stock Connect instruments retain HKD trading-price metadata and broker receipts retain the actual RMB settlement/fee facts, but neither creates an FX quote cache, currency balance, fee formula, nor an execution path. CN remains executable; HK/US are intentionally research/audit-only.
3. Atomic Evidence and ResearchAssessment are deterministic and persisted. The DecisionArbiter consumes only high-confidence ADVERSE research as a new-risk veto; it never lets research upgrade an action or produce REDUCE/EXIT. Completed weekly/daily plus governed 60m/15m/5m state now feed a versioned asymmetric Multi-Timeframe ActionPolicy before DecisionContinuity. Raw intraday timestamp/hash noise is excluded from the continuity material fingerprint.
4. Model policy/audit is repository-complete for the configured provider's bounded recovery graph, while the live provider black-box acceptance remains open under #40. A generic provider-capability registry remains out of scope.
5. Feedback is immutable audit data and has no policy/sizing/model-routing write path. Strategy Evaluation and AI calibration will consume this foundation but also have no automatic production write path.
6. Repository quality, time and freeze invariants remain the migration anchors.
7. Production verification on 2026-08-18 confirmed that the deployed ledger correctly blocks same-day CN sells, but Phase 5 is not closed until the #46 deployed acceptance matrix confirms no impossible order leaks through decision/sizing/scheduler/session/UI behavior.
8. `DECISION_SHADOW_MODE` controls research/decision shadow output; it is not a switch for the simulated ledger. Automatic paper fills are governed by the persisted paper-trading setting and every execution entry point must honor the paper-execution safety contract.
9. Report-period currentness and official CorporateEvent lifecycle reconciliation are implemented in repository code, but deployed Xiaomi/HK acceptance remains active.
10. Android already has Watchlist API consumption and a buried self-selected list/add flow, but the bottom navigation remains News/Market/Trading/Admin. The new design promotes Watchlist to a first-class product entry rather than creating duplicate storage.
11. Existing Candidate lifecycle/cooldown remains useful as Discovery research infrastructure; it must no longer be presented as an AI stock-picking authority.
12. Existing adaptive DISCOVERY/HOLDING_FOCUS/FULL_FOCUS scheduling already suppresses new discovery near full allocation, but it still conflates capital occupancy with research cadence. The new design separates universe membership, review permission and analysis depth.
13. PUX1 backend/API now has an implementation branch with typed Personal Universe contracts, additive Watchlist metadata migration, local-only composition and explicit v2 routes; it remains unaccepted until #86 CI passes and is not user-visible until the Android slice lands.

Therefore v3 remains an evolution of the present architecture, not a rewrite.

## C. Historical v3 target requirements and acceptance criteria

The following phase descriptions remain the historical/core v3 contract. Status
at the start of this file overrides their tense: an item remains active until
its stated acceptance criteria and any explicitly required deployed acceptance
are met.

### Phase 0 — Architecture/documentation lock
Deliverables:
- consolidated v3 architecture
- ledger disposition
- formal call-chain map
- migration/compatibility rules

Acceptance:
- no duplicate quality system
- no alternate freeze path
- all new components have a clear authority owner

### Phase 1 — Data correctness and market identity — repository complete
Goal: make every formal calculation use coherent market-specific inputs before changing strategy semantics.

Implement:
- InstrumentMetadata / market identity
- CanonicalInputSnapshot
- explicit execution quote vs display close
- CrossSourceConsistency checks
- CorporateEventAdapter
- market-specific benchmark/regime selection
- stale risk quarantine through existing quality machinery

Acceptance:
- stale quote cannot be mixed with newer technical bars as if same-time
- event date is first-class Evidence
- HK symbols no longer use CSI300 regime
- market metadata is explicit
- current A-share golden output is unchanged

### Phase 2 — Atomic Evidence foundation — complete
Implement:
- AtomicFactRecord
- FactExtractor
- compact EvidenceSnapshot
- deterministic availability/conflict list
- fact-level provenance/materiality/comparison adequacy

Build after ActionPolicy candidates freeze. The raw snapshot does not directly
change action, sizing or execution; later deterministic aggregation may only
exercise the explicitly bounded research authority defined in this document.

Acceptance:
- one source can produce multiple facts with different polarity
- every fact has provenance
- atomic snapshot hashes deterministically
- same input creates same facts

### Phase 3 — Deterministic research aggregation — complete
Implement:
- DimensionAggregationPolicy
- FundamentalAggregationPolicy
- ResearchAggregationPolicy
- evidence/research/decision confidence split
- SemanticInvariantValidator

Acceptance:
- same EvidenceSnapshot + policy versions => identical formal ResearchAssessment
- rerunning a model cannot change formal aggregate research bias
- benchmark-only Xiaomi weights are not production defaults

### Phase 4 — Decision semantics and state machine — repository complete
Implement:
- EntryDecision and PositionDecision types
- remove `NO_TRADE -> REDUCE`
- position states
- EventRiskGate
- DecisionArbiter
- governed multi-timeframe authority

Acceptance:
- negative research bias can produce WAIT
- held-position actions use HOLD/ADD/REDUCE/EXIT only
- entry actions use BUY/WAIT/BLOCKED only
- every hard gate has reason codes
- high-confidence ADVERSE research may downgrade BUY to WAIT or ADD to HOLD, but cannot create or upgrade any action
- 60m/15m/5m may only preserve/delay/downgrade already permitted new risk
- lower-timeframe state cannot manufacture BUY/ADD or create REDUCE/EXIT
- higher-timeframe structural conflict cannot be overridden by bullish intraday state
- DecisionContinuity material fingerprint records discrete approved timeframe states but excludes raw timing/hash noise

### Phase 5 — Market/execution adapters — active deployed acceptance
Implement:
- CN_A/HK/US market adapter interface
- lot/tick/fees/currency/settlement
- PositionLot and sellable quantity
- single-CNY paper-execution boundary
- execution precheck before sizing
- T+1 deferral state, calendar/session/freshness gate, and persisted runtime status

Acceptance:
- no global 100-share rule
- no global A-share T+1 rule
- HK/US rules are selected by instrument market
- a foreign-currency quote can never create a paper-execution conversion path
- Stock Connect broker receipts preserve the actual RMB settlement and fee as audit evidence only; no general FX ledger or broker-fee formula is inferred
- `REDUCE`/`EXIT` can never size or submit more than `sellable_quantity`; a same-day lot produces one explainable T+1 deferral with its next eligible sell time, not repeated skipped SELL attempts
- manual or scheduler execution outside the instrument's open session, on a non-trading day, or with stale/out-of-session quotes cannot write a paper fill
- account/API exposes sellable and locked quantity plus read-only lot evidence, and status survives a process restart by reading persisted runs
- deployed-container isolated-SQLite acceptance matrix in #46 passes before Phase 5 is marked complete

### Phase 6 — Decision continuity — complete
Implement:
- DecisionMemory
- entry-bound position episode id and frozen entry snapshot
- material-change detector
- cooldown/review-after
- prior decision reference

Acceptance:
- changed recommendation states what changed
- repeated analyses cannot flip without material change unless a hard gate changed
- an unchanged EvidenceSnapshot that permitted `BUY` when FLAT cannot produce `REDUCE`/`EXIT` solely because the resulting position is now HOLDING
- a full `input_hash` difference is retained for audit, while only a versioned strategic material fingerprint can permit an action flip
- execution rejects a fill before `cooldown_until`
- due `review_after` produces a separately auditable decision-refresh obligation, never an implied trade
- first paper BUY persists decision/evidence/research/state/price provenance; ADD cannot overwrite it and full EXIT closes the episode

### Phase 7 — Model policy and audit — repository complete, live acceptance active
Implement:
- compact atomic research prompt
- configured-provider ModelPolicy
- default vs reasoning escalation plus one bounded structured recovery
- schema + semantic validation
- observable runtime audit

Acceptance:
- every model run auditable by hashes/settings/usage
- invalid output never mutates formal decision
- finite recovery transitions are recorded
- provider-specific maximum-reasoning tiers remain out of scope until a stable tested capability contract exists
- live configured-provider black-box under #40 confirms the persisted compound attempt lineage and bounded fail-closed behavior

### Phase 8 — Feedback — audit foundation complete
Implement:
- FeedbackEvent
- execution/outcome link
- hypothetical-vs-actual review
- policy-version evaluation dataset

Acceptance:
- feedback points to an exact frozen decision/package
- no automatic tuning in first production release

## D. Current correctness closure gate — P0 before new product breadth

Do not treat the next-stage Strategy/AI Lab as permission to bypass open runtime
acceptance. Close or explicitly re-scope these first:

1. **#46 Paper execution safety** — deployed isolated-SQLite acceptance for T+1,
   mixed inventory, fresh later quote, closed/stale session blocks and restart
   recovery.
2. **#39 Financial currentness** — deployed Xiaomi/HK confirms old financials
   remain historical while the newly released report is refreshed/current only
   through bounded official-release-aware acquisition.
3. **#49 CorporateEvent lifecycle** — deployed Tier-1 HKEX ingestion + verified
   financial snapshot closes RELEASED_UNVERIFIED -> VERIFIED without regression.
4. **#40 Decision AI runtime** — live provider acceptance confirms bounded
   recovery/audit while formal action remains deterministic and fail-closed.

These are correctness/reliability gates, not reasons to freeze unrelated UI
read-model work. User-visible Personal Universe/Watchlist work may proceed when
it does not weaken or hide these gates.

## E. Next-stage product and technical roadmap

The detailed dependency/endpoint/Android mapping lives in
`ThirdHand_v3_Fullstack_Technical_Roadmap.md`. Personal Universe / Review Cadence
is additionally governed by
`ThirdHand_v3_Personal_Universe_Review_Watchlist_UX_Design.md`.

### PUX1 — Personal Universe + first-class Watchlist — IMPLEMENTING

Current delivery state: backend/API implementation is under CI in #86. Android
first-class entry is not yet implemented, so PUX1 is not `ANDROID_VISIBLE`,
`OBSERVABLE`, or `PRODUCT_DONE`.

Backend/domain:
- additive Watchlist metadata with priority/note/enabled on the existing table;
- typed Personal Universe membership for POSITION/WATCHLIST/both;
- always include all open positions;
- local-only composition from Portfolio + Watchlist and cached display data;
- no Decision/AI/remote-research invocation from the read model.

API:
- preserve existing GET/POST/DELETE `/v1/watchlist`;
- add `PUT /v1/watchlist/{symbol}` for attention metadata;
- add read-only `GET /v1/personal-universe`;
- defer Personal Universe Discovery/settings endpoints to PUX3 when runtime ownership exists.

Android:
- promote Watchlist to a first-class bottom-navigation destination;
- implement Watchlist/Positions sibling tabs;
- manage add/edit/delete/priority/note from the normal user surface;
- use dense scan-first list layout aligned with the project red-first market tokens.

Acceptance:
- no admin/log screen is required to manage Watchlist;
- positions cannot be dropped by a list limit;
- loading/empty/stale/error states are explicit;
- screenshot/preview states are locked;
- this slice cannot be called PRODUCT_DONE before the real Android path exists.

### PUX2 — ReviewPolicy + AnalysisBudget — DESIGNED

Backend/domain:
- modes: `NO_REVIEW`, `GUARD_ONLY`, `POSITION_REVIEW`, `FULL_RESEARCH`;
- persist per-symbol review reason, last/next review and routine analysis budget;
- scheduler wake-up does not imply full-analysis permission;
- a full/capped `SWING_V1` position without MaterialChange remains GUARD_ONLY
  during the session;
- routine full research is at most once per symbol/trading day unless a material
  trigger or explicit user request supplies an audited override reason.

API/Android:
- expose ReviewPlan and whether full AI/company research actually ran;
- show skipped-analysis reasons so quiet behavior cannot be mistaken for failure.

Acceptance:
- full position + no material change causes zero routine intraday full-research calls;
- hard invalidation/event/risk/T+1 guards still run;
- material triggers deterministically upgrade the review mode;
- Android shows the reason and next review time.

### PUX3 — Discovery demotion and controls — DESIGNED

Backend/domain:
- reuse Candidate lifecycle as a research-only Discovery substrate;
- default `discovery_enabled=false`, `discovery_slots=2`, cadence every 3 trading sessions;
- allow zero slots as explicit pause;
- default Basic Screen performs no full DeepSeek Company Research;
- explicit user promotion is required before durable Watchlist membership.

API/Android:
- Discovery list + settings + manual run;
- user controls enable/disable, slots and cadence;
- each item supports Add to Watchlist / Ignore and explains only why it may merit research.

Acceptance:
- Discovery cannot silently become Formal BUY scope;
- Discovery can be fully disabled;
- default Discovery produces no full-model research call;
- promotion is explicit and auditable.

### N1 — StrategyProfile + SWING_V1

Status: `PRODUCT_DONE` via #63.

### N2 — Decision Workspace vertical slice

Backend/API:
- provide one read model that joins Formal Decision, Strategy, What Changed,
  financial/event state, timeframe authority and paper-risk state without
  introducing new authority.

Android:
- refactor stock detail incrementally into an action-first Decision Workspace;
- show Formal Action, invalidation/review reason, strategy/timeframe state,
  company/event state, sellable/locked/T+1, AI Research and Decision Memory;
- implement loading, partial error, stale and blocked states.

Acceptance:
- a user does not need admin/log screens to understand why the current formal
  action exists or why it cannot execute;
- backend-only completion is not enough; this milestone ends at `PRODUCT_DONE`.

### N3 — Evaluation Infrastructure

Backend/domain:
- add `ExperimentDefinition`, `OutcomePolicy`, `StrategyEvaluation`, benchmark
  definitions and point-in-time lineage;
- compute performance with fees/slippage and separate economic vs forecast outcomes;
- use a frozen ExperimentUniversePolicy; do not read mutable Personal Watchlist membership.

API:
- experiment list/detail;
- evaluation summary;
- benchmark comparison;
- sample-quality/calibration summary.

Android:
- Lab shell renders real experiment/evaluation data even before AI autonomous paper fills are enabled.

Acceptance:
- evaluation can score Formal SWING_V1 against a benchmark without any AI agent;
- every metric resolves to an immutable experiment/policy version;
- Personal Watchlist mutations do not alter an existing experiment sample.

### N4 — AI Strategy Lab Shadow

Backend:
- define Trader AI output schema with paper intent plus testable ForecastContract;
- consume the same frozen EvidenceSnapshot used by the comparable formal decision;
- persist model/prompt/evidence/strategy/risk/sizing versions;
- no AI paper fill yet.

API/Android:
- show AI shadow opinion beside Formal Decision with explicit `LAB` status;
- show disagreements and confidence event definition;
- never label an uncalibrated probability as historical reliability.

Acceptance:
- AI failure cannot alter Formal Action;
- every AI percentage has an outcome contract;
- shadow records are replayable/auditable.

### N5 — Isolated AI Paper Trading

Backend:
- one experiment account/ledger per AI agent/version;
- AI owns directional intent only by default;
- deterministic RiskPolicy/SizingPolicy/ExecutionPrecheck/Paper Broker own risk and fill;
- experiment agent cannot write ledger directly.

API/Android:
- Lab shows account equity, cash, positions, fills, blocked/deferred intents and execution reasons.

Acceptance:
- two agents cannot share cash/positions;
- T+1/session/freshness rules match the authoritative Paper Broker contract;
- blocked or deferred AI intents remain visible and explainable.

### N6 — Calibration and reliability UX

Backend:
- confidence buckets, Brier score, calibration error, sample size, uncertainty interval, regime/action breakdown.

Android:
- display historical event rate + interval + `n`;
- show `INSUFFICIENT_SAMPLE` instead of fake precision;
- compare AI, Formal SWING_V1 and benchmark.

Acceptance:
- the UI never shows a naked "reliability X%";
- user can see where an agent is overconfident, underconfident or regime-fragile.

### N7 — Home + Review

Backend/API:
- material-change feed and review aggregates from existing immutable history;
- no new trading authority.

Android Home:
- show only actionable material changes: position decision changes, due reviews,
  major events, data failures and Formal-vs-AI disagreement.

Android Review:
- classify good/bad entries/exits, missed opportunities, over/under-confidence,
  regime failure, data failure and execution failure.

Acceptance:
- a low-effort user can open the app once and understand what changed and what needs review.

### N8 — Order Flow as evaluated timing evidence

Backend:
- implement read-only OrderFlowSnapshot/evidence first;
- persist freshness/provenance/degraded state;
- keep it out of formal action authority initially.

API/Android:
- stock detail shows active-buying/support evidence with source/freshness and contradiction state.

Evaluation:
- compare timing with and without OrderFlow under frozen SWING_V1 baseline.

Acceptance:
- only benchmark/forward evidence can justify a separately versioned timing-policy promotion;
- no order-flow score directly creates BUY/ADD/REDUCE/EXIT.

### N9 — Modularization tied to vertical slices

Backend:
- migrate new Strategy/Experiment/Evaluation code into domain/application/infrastructure modules;
- gradually move root-level legacy modules behind stable adapters.

Android:
- extract feature ViewModels/repositories/API services from `MainActivity.kt` and monolithic `ApiClient.kt` as each visible milestone lands;
- Personal Universe/Watchlist must use its own feature boundary rather than growing MainActivity further;
- do not perform a big-bang rewrite.

Acceptance:
- each extraction is covered by compile/tests and preserves behavior;
- architecture cleanup must deliver or protect a user-visible vertical slice rather than becoming open-ended refactoring.

## F. Full-stack completion states

Every user-facing milestone uses these states:

```text
DESIGNED
  -> BACKEND_READY
  -> API_VISIBLE
  -> ANDROID_VISIBLE
  -> OBSERVABLE
  -> PRODUCT_DONE
```

Definitions:

- `BACKEND_READY`: authoritative domain/persistence/application behavior exists and is tested.
- `API_VISIBLE`: stable DTO/read model exposes the behavior with reason/freshness/degraded states.
- `ANDROID_VISIBLE`: real repository-backed UI renders it.
- `OBSERVABLE`: audit/reason/source/freshness/failure state is diagnosable without server log archaeology.
- `PRODUCT_DONE`: end-to-end acceptance passes, including loading/empty/error/stale/blocked paths where applicable.

A backend feature that the user cannot see is not `PRODUCT_DONE`. A UI mock that
is disconnected from real authoritative data is not `PRODUCT_DONE` either.

## H. Required PR governance

Any PR that changes `Authority`, `Strategy`, `Evidence`, `Decision`, `Risk`,
`Execution`, `Evaluation`, Personal Universe, or Review cadence must state:

- Authority Impact
- Strategy Impact
- API / Android Visibility Impact
- Backward Compatibility
- Evaluation Impact
- Acceptance Tests
- Delivery State (`BACKEND_READY`, `API_VISIBLE`, etc.)

Every Personal Universe/Review implementation commit that advances delivery must
update this Ledger in the same commit. If it changes current authority or safety
conformance, it must also update the canonical Architecture and the subordinate
Personal Universe design. No backend-only implementation may claim
`PRODUCT_DONE`.

## I. Required regression invariants

Preserve repository-fixed golden results until a later explicitly scoped strategy change:
- READY
- buy zone [10.4209, 10.5391]
- hard stop 9.7023
- final quantity 600
- trial quantity 100
- per-share risk 0.7777
- max loss 77.77

Also preserve:
- one formal plan per analysis
- unique account/symbol/version behavior
- quality blocking
- package hash reproducibility
- unified freeze
- provider lineage
- no automatic production tuning from Feedback or AI experiment performance
- no AI direct write to authoritative paper execution state
- every open position remains in Personal Universe risk monitoring
- mutable Personal Watchlist cannot alter a frozen ExperimentUniverse
- Watchlist/Discovery membership alone cannot grant trading authority
- scheduler wake-up alone cannot authorize a full research rerun

## J. Delivery update — 2026-08-20

- **N1 StrategyProfile / SWING_V1:** `PRODUCT_DONE` via #63. The immutable
  `SWING_V1` identity and policy-version lineage are serialized in DecisionReport
  and rendered in Android stock detail together with structured timeframe
  authority. Formal action semantics were unchanged and full backend + Android
  CI passed before merge.
- **P0 #46 paper-execution visibility:** backend/API sellability and deferral
  facts were already authoritative. Android Trading consumes
  `sellable_quantity`, `locked_quantity`, `next_eligible_sell_at`, runtime
  `state_source`, and active execution deferrals and renders explicit T+1/
  next-review reasons. This slice is `ANDROID_VISIBLE / OBSERVABLE`; **Phase 5
  remains open** until deployed acceptance passes.
- **N2 Decision Workspace:** multiple backend/API/Android slices are merged,
  including continuity, strategy/timeframe, financial/event completeness,
  action-first detail hierarchy, typed route state and screenshot regressions.
  Device-level acceptance remains tracked separately; these slices do not alter
  Formal Decision authority.
- **#75 cache-first symbol search:** local identities resolve without blocking on
  provider I/O and true misses use bounded background enrichment. This is useful
  infrastructure for the Watchlist Add flow and introduces no trading authority.
- **PUX1 Personal Universe / Watchlist:** implementation is active in #86. The
  branch adds typed Watchlist/Personal Universe contracts, additive
  `0019_pux1_watchlist_metadata`, local-only Portfolio + Watchlist composition,
  explicit `GET /v1/personal-universe` and `PUT /v1/watchlist/{symbol}`, v2 route
  registration and regression tests. This state is `BACKEND/API UNDER CI`, not
  accepted and not user-visible until the Android first-class Watchlist slice
  lands.
- **PUX2 Review Cadence / AnalysisBudget and PUX3 Discovery controls:** remain
  `DESIGNED`. The approved target makes Portfolio + explicit Watchlist the
  primary personal research universe, demotes Candidate Pool product semantics
  to optional Discovery, separates Personal and Experiment universes, and
  introduces `NO_REVIEW/GUARD_ONLY/POSITION_REVIEW/FULL_RESEARCH` plus an
  observable AnalysisBudget. Implementation order remains PUX1 -> PUX2 -> PUX3.
